System requirements (10 pts, due 10/6/16)
Submit a system requirements document (PDF with a UML use case diagram, no page limit) as described below:

Begin with a narrative to give a general overview of the system's functional requirements. Provide one big use case diagram 
illustrating the overall functionality of the system. Describe each use case in an easy to understand natural language. (2 pts)

Using the use case diagram as a starting point, convert each use case into a user story. 
Organize your user stories as a numbered list. (2 pts)

A typical format of the user story is as follows: As a user role, I want goal so that reason:
The user role represents an actor or a developer who benefits from this story;
The goal of the story is a feature or function in the system, a tool, or a part of a production pipeline;
The reason describes the benefit to the customer or user when this feature or function is used.
For each user story, provide a set of pre- and post-conditions (refer to each corresponding user story by their numbers). 
Note: list pre- and post-conditions under the corresponding user story. Note: there should be a single list of user stories in your document. (2 pts)
Are there any user stories that are too big or complex? Can some of them be decomposed into smaller user stories? 
For each user story, mention whether or not it may need to be broken down (this will be done later). (1 pt)

Provide a separate list of any relevant nonfunctional requirements. (1 pt)

Include a glossary that defines all relevant terms that may have a special meaning in the context of the system. (2 pts)
