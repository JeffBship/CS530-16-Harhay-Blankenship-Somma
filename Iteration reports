Iteration reports (3 @ 10 pts each, due 11/3/16, 11/17/16, 12/6/16)

At the end of each iteration, submit an iteration report (PDF, no page limit) containing the following:

What functionality does the system have at the end of this iteration? (2 pts)

List the user stories that you have implemented at this iteration. (1 pt)

Did you end up making any changes to any of these user stories? Did you break down further any the user stories? 
Did you identify any new user stories during this iteration and, if so, did you add them to the product backlog or 
decide to implement them right away? Explain. (2 pts)

What are the "lessons learned" at the end of this iteration? What would you do differently next time? Explain. (2 pt)

Provide an updated numbered list of all user stories yet to be implemented; indicate pre- and post-conditions. (1 pt)

(2 pts)
If this is not the last iteration:
Given the current functionality of the system and taking into account the pre- and post-conditions, identify a 
subset of user stories to be implemented during the next iteration. Be sure that the cumulative size of the selected 
user stories is about 1/3 of the size of the full backlog. Describe the functionality that your (partially implemented) 
system will have at the end of this iteration.

If this is the last iteration:
Are there any user stories left unimplemented in the backlog? Are there any new user stories that you would consider 
adding to the backlog. List these user stories and explain them.
