Product backlog (10 pts, due 10/20/16)

Submit a detailed prioritized product backlog document (PDF, no page limit) as described below:

Refine your user stories taking into account the instructor's feedback. Break down previously identified large user stories. (2 pts)

Estimate the size of your user stories. Use Fibonacci numbers to represent a relative size of each user story. 
Note the cumulative size of all user stories in your product backlog. (2 pts)

Provide an updated numbered list of all user stories; indicate pre- and post-conditions. (1 pt)

Taking into account the pre- and post-conditions, identify a subset of user stories to be implemented during 
the first iteration (there will be a total of three iterations). Be sure that the cumulative size of the selected 
user stories is about 1/3 of the size of the full backlog. Describe the functionality that your partially implemented 
system will have at the end of this iteration. (3 pts)

Design key features of the user interface; provide sketches of your designs. (2 pts)
